What is this?
--------------

 This is an another Squid proxy external ACL helper. It utilises new Squid
External ACLs mechanism named 'notes'. It is threaded and very fast, also it
is quite flexible.
 The main reason why I wrote this is the need in modification of Squid HTTP
reqests processing based on settings from various sources, including databases,
files and even remote host SSL cert status.


The helper operates in 'concurrent' mode.

(more docs: TBW)


Notes:
----------

- SSL host certificate check
If SSL checker type called then SSL host verification will be done
and its result will be returned as 'note' in form of 'ssl_error=XX'
where XX is an SSL check error integer value (see openssl macros
in /usr/include/openssl/x509_vfy.h)
Predefined (and hardcoded for now) string 'ssl_error' can be found 
in ./src/ssl.h file
